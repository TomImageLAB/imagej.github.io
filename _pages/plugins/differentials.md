This plugin allows you to perform several differentiation operations on images, seen as continuous functions, even though they are stored as discrete pixels.

The plugin is described in detail on the [BIG website](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/differentials/).

Enable the [BIG-EPFL update site](/update-sites/big-epfl) to gain access to the Differentials plugin.
