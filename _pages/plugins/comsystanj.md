## About ComsystanJ
ComsystanJ (Complex Systems Analysis for ImageJ) is a collection of ImageJ2/Fiji plugins to compute the complexity, fractal dimension and other nonlinear measures of 1D signals, 2D images and 3D image volumes. It is recommended to use it with Fiji. Developed and maintained by Helmut Ahammer.
